# IPA-chart-popup
Make the IPA chart pop up with a hotkey

# Installation and use
First, Install AHK from https://www.autohotkey.com.

Download the .ahk-file and the .png-file, then run the AHK script. Use ALT+z to make an IPA chart pop up.

Hotkey is set to ALT+z. Refer to https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/howto/WriteHotkeys.htm.

If the chart is to big or small, change the h1000 value to something else to fit your screen (h1000 = 1000 pixels high).

# Issues

I would like to make a nicer GUI so you can zoom in or change the size of the chart.
